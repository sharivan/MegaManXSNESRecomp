# MegaManXSNESRecomp

Static recompilation of *Mega Man X* (SNES) into native C, using the
[snesrecomp](https://github.com/mstan/snesrecomp) framework. This repo
is the per-game side: the runtime, the recompiled C output, the
per-game `.cfg`, and the build glue.

## What "static recompilation" means here

The 65816 CPU code from the ROM is statically translated to C — every
function the analysis can prove is a real generated C function in
`src/gen/`. Execution is **LLE-first**: an authoritative 65816
interpreter (LakeSnes-derived, MIT) is the correctness floor, and the
statically compiled bodies are exact, proven materializations on top of
it — anything the static pass cannot prove keeps running through the
interpreter, loudly. **The rest of the SNES is not recompiled** — it's
hardware. PPU rendering, the APU/SPC700 audio coprocessor, DMA and
HDMA channels, hardware register I/O, and bank-mapping run through
snesrecomp's own runner implementations (`snesrecomp/runner/`). Same
model as N64Recomp and similar projects: recompile the CPU, emulate the
silicon.

The ROM is **never** redistributed — you supply your own legally-dumped
copy.

## Current status: fully playable

The game has been tested and is playable end to end on Windows, with
macOS and Linux builds supported from source. See
[Releases](../../releases) for the latest packaged version and
[ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) for the current known-issue ledger.

The USA Rev 1 build now also includes an **experimental true widescreen Mod**,
rendering additional gameplay at the sides instead of stretching the original
image. It is disabled by default and enabled from the launcher's **Mods** page.
See [Experimental widescreen support](#experimental-widescreen-support) for
availability and controls.

### Linux / Steam Deck validation

Tester **littlerobotfairy** completed the game on Linux running on Steam
Deck (on the contributed widescreen fork build). The complete playthrough
is documented in the [Twitch VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2820912518).

If you hit a reproducible lockup or visual regression, please open an
issue with a savestate (`Shift+F1`) and the frame at which it
manifested.

## Quick start (pre-built release)

1. Download the latest release zip from [Releases](../../releases) and
   extract it.
2. Run `mmx.exe`. On first launch a file picker asks for your
   **legally-obtained** *Mega Man X (USA) (Rev 1)* ROM (`.sfc` /
   `.smc`). The expected SHA-256 is
   `b8f70a6e7fb93819f79693578887e2c11e196bdf1ac6ddc7cb924b1ad0be2d32`
   (1.5 MiB, LoROM). 512-byte SMC copier headers are auto-stripped
   before hashing, so headered or unheadered both work.
3. Edit `keybinds.ini` (auto-generated next to the exe on first run) to
   remap keys, then restart.

The path you pick is cached to `rom.cfg` next to the exe so subsequent
launches skip the picker.

## Controls (default `keybinds.ini`)

| SNES button | Default key |
|-------------|-------------|
| D-Pad       | Arrow keys |
| A           | X |
| B           | Z |
| X           | S |
| Y           | A |
| L           | C |
| R           | V |
| Start       | Enter |
| Select      | Right Shift |

Player 2 is unbound by default — fill in keys in `keybinds.ini` to
enable a second keyboard player.

**Xbox / PlayStation / Switch Pro controllers** are auto-detected via
SDL_GameController (XInput on Windows). Plug it in before launching, or
hot-plug after.

System shortcuts (all rebindable in `config.ini`'s `[KeyMap]` section;
set a key to an empty value there to unbind it, e.g. `DisplayPerf =`):

| Action               | Default |
|----------------------|---------|
| Save state 1-10      | Shift+F1..F10 |
| Load state 1-10      | F1..F10 (except macOS/Linux F1) |
| Toggle pause         | P |
| Pause (dimmed)       | Shift+P |
| Reset                | Ctrl+R |
| Toggle fullscreen    | Alt+Enter |
| Turbo (fast-forward) | Tab |
| FPS / perf readout   | F |
| Toggle PPU renderer  | R |
| Volume up / down     | Shift+= / Shift+- |

## Reporting crashes

The game continuously records its own boot/run diagnostics. If it
crashes (or exits with an error), it writes these files next to
`mmx.exe` — attaching them to a GitHub issue usually lets the crash be
diagnosed without a repro:

- `crash_report_<timestamp>.json` and `crash_minidump_<timestamp>.dmp`
  — written at the moment of a crash; never overwritten by later runs.
- `last_run_report.json` — written at the end of **every** run
  (crash or clean exit), so grab it right after the bad run if there
  is no `crash_report_*` file.

None of these contain personal data beyond your Windows version,
hardware model, and the folder path the game runs from.

## Building from source

Clone with all framework dependencies, then run the idempotent
bootstrap check:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mstan/MegaManXSNESRecomp.git
cd MegaManXSNESRecomp
bash tools/bootstrap.sh
```

The `snesrecomp/` directory is a pinned submodule from
[mstan/snesrecomp](https://github.com/mstan/snesrecomp), and `recomp-ui/`
is the shared launcher UI submodule. If you cloned without
`--recurse-submodules`, `tools/bootstrap.sh` initializes them and their
nested dependencies. The gitlink in this repository is the dependency pin;
there is no separate SHA to keep synchronized.

Generated game C is not redistributed. Before the first build, stage a legally
obtained USA Rev 1 ROM as `mmx.sfc`, then run:

```bash
cp "/path/to/Mega Man X (USA Rev 1).sfc" mmx.sfc
bash tools/regen.sh usa --no-tests
```

On Windows 10 or newer, install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) with the
mingw64 toolchain (`cmake`, `ninja`), the SDL3 development package, Git,
Python 3.9 or newer, and `rustup`. Run the bootstrap and regeneration steps
from Git Bash, then:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-recompui -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/SDL3/x86_64-w64-mingw32
cmake --build build-recompui
# or, packaged: SDL3_MINGW_ROOT=/path/to/SDL3 bash tools/build-windows-mingw.sh VERSION
```

SDL3 is the default. SDL2 remains an explicitly supported fallback: configure
a separate tree with `-DSNESRECOMP_SDL_BACKEND=SDL2`.

Windows releases are built and packaged this way (CMake/mingw with the
recomp-ui launcher; see `tools/make_release.ps1`). The Visual Studio
solution (`mmx.sln`) is also maintained as a developer/debugging harness
(MSVC, with a `Production` config) and builds the same recomp-ui
launcher:

```powershell
msbuild mmx.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64 /m
```

### macOS / Linux (CMake)

Builds natively on macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel) and Linux with clang/gcc.
On macOS, install dependencies with
`brew install cmake sdl3 ninja python3`. On Ubuntu/Debian, install
`build-essential cmake ninja-build libsdl3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev python3`.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-dev -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build-dev --target MegaManXSNESRecomp
ctest --test-dir build-dev --output-on-failure
```

On macOS, add `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix)"` if CMake does not find
Homebrew's SDL3. Apple Silicon contributors running an x86_64-translated shell
must also configure with `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64`. Packaging helpers
detect the native hardware architecture and are documented by
`bash tools/build-macos.sh --help` and `bash tools/build-linux.sh --help`.
The cross-platform Windows release can be built with MinGW using
`SDL3_MINGW_ROOT=/path/to/SDL3 bash tools/build-windows-mingw.sh VERSION`.
All release packages are ROM-free; place your legally obtained ROM beside the
executable or AppImage after extraction.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for dependency development, validation,
and pull-request guidance.

macOS builds use the same SDL3 + CMake path as Linux. A native macOS
backend (Metal presentation, `GameController.framework`,
Core Audio output) and an optional in-game display menu were contributed
in [PR #10](../../pull/10) and are staged on per-feature branches; they
land after the shared launcher-UI restructure settles.

### Experimental widescreen support

The USA Rev 1 build includes an experimental true-widescreen renderer. It
draws genuine additional PPU columns rather than stretching the original
picture. The implementation widens presentation and ordinary enemy activation
while keeping the camera, collision, scripted room and stage triggers, and
save-state data on their original timing and coordinates.

The launcher's **Settings** page offers three independent display presentations:
**4:3 (CRT)** is the default traditional-TV correction, **8:7 (Square pixels)**
maps each 256x224 game pixel to a square, and **1:1 (Square frame)** deliberately
fits the whole image into a square. These are presentation choices, not gameplay
mods.

Enable the default-disabled **Widescreen (Extended view)** feature from the
launcher's **Mods** page, then start the game. It adds one third more horizontal
game area while preserving the chosen pixel shape, producing approximately
16:9 from 4:3, 32:21 from 8:7, or 4:3 from a 1:1 frame. This support is still
experimental, so visual or gameplay edge cases may remain; please report
reproducible regressions with a savestate and screenshot. Widescreen is
currently not exposed for Rockman X (Japan).

The S-DSP retains the SNES BRR predictor filters and canonical four-tap
Gaussian interpolation. Host-rate conversion uses continuous interpolation
instead of nearest-sample hold. The current SPC700 core is instruction-cycle
stepped with canonical opcode timing; a sub-cycle bsnes-style SPC700 core is a
separate emulator-core replacement and is not represented as complete here.

The supported packaged workflow is:

```bash
bash tools/build-macos.sh --rom "/path/to/your/rom.sfc" --regen --no-dmg
```

The script builds an arm64 `.app` by default; use `--arch universal` for an
Intel/Apple Silicon package. The ROM is used only for local regeneration and
is never copied into release output.

The recompiled C in `src/gen/` is **not** committed — contributors must
regenerate it from a local ROM before the first build. See the next
section.

### Regenerating the recompiled C (contributors)

1. Stage a legally-obtained USA Rev 1 ROM as `mmx.sfc` at the repo root
   (`.gitignore` excludes it), or pass it to `tools/build-macos.sh --rom`.
2. Run `bash tools/regen.sh usa --no-tests` (drives the recompiler over every
   `recomp/bank*.cfg` and writes `src/gen/bankXX_v2.c` + `dispatch_v2.c`).
   The script builds and requires the fast native analyzer by default; set
   `SNESRECOMP_ANALYSIS_BACKEND=python` only to use the slower reference path.
   On Windows without bash, invoke the underlying tool directly:
   ```bash
   python snesrecomp/tools/build_native_analyzer.py
   python snesrecomp/tools/v2_emit.py --rom mmx.sfc --cfg-dir recomp --out-dir src/gen --cfg-roots --analysis-backend native
   ```
3. Rebuild as above.

For Rockman X (Japan v1.1), stage `rockmanx.sfc` under
`variants/jp/roms/` and run `bash tools/regen.sh jp --no-tests`. The JP path
uses its checked-in LLE coverage profile as optional AOT input; variants the
compiler cannot prove remain on the authoritative interpreter fallback.
`bash tools/regen.sh all` regenerates both regions.

## Repo layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/` | Runtime C (CPU state glue, NMI orchestration, hand-written bodies for things the framework doesn't recompile). |
| `src/gen/` | Recompiler output (gitignored; regenerated from ROM). |
| `recomp/bank*.cfg` | Per-bank function declarations + hardware hints the framework cannot derive from the ROM alone. |
| `recomp/funcs.h` | Auto-regenerated by `tools/regen.sh`; never hand-edit. |
| `snesrecomp/` | Pinned submodule containing the [snesrecomp framework](https://github.com/mstan/snesrecomp). |
| `recomp-ui/` | Pinned submodule containing the shared, console-agnostic launcher UI. |
| `third_party/` | Vendored deps (gl_core, stb_image) with their own licenses. |
| `mmx.sln` + `src/mmx.vcxproj` | Visual Studio build glue. |
| `config.ini` | The config. Generated next to the exe on first run if missing. |
